# Late frosts constrain sugar maple regeneration at its northern range limit, while light mitigates harsh climatic conditions

This repository contains the R code and data to retrieve the results and graphs from the "doi here" study. We aimed to determine whether temperature and frost events limits the regeneration of sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_ Marshall) seedlings, an emblematic temperate tree species, beyond its northern range limit using transplantation experiment.

## Acknowledgement

Firstly, we would like to acknowledge the contribution of Bernhard Denneler and Igor Drobyshev, who were involved in the conceptualisation of the project and the sampling. We thank the nursery situated at Sainte-Geneviève-de-Berthier, QC, managed by the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et des Forêts (MRNF) of Quebec, for providing sugar maple seeds and seedlings that were required for this study. We are also grateful to the MRNF for providing space within forested areas to set up the study sites. This study was made possible by financial support provided by the NSERC-UQAT-UQAM Industrial Chair in Sustainable Forest Management (Y.B.) and a NSERC strategic Grant to F. Tremblay.
